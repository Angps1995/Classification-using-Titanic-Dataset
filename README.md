# Classification-using-Titanic-Dataset
The aim of this project is to predict which passengers would survive, or die, in the Titanic crash 
using various features (age, which cabin they stayed in, social status etc). This was done in 
Python and the notebook involved all the steps taken for data visualization, data cleaning, 
feature engineering and also building and testing different classification models (Logistic regressions, SVM, Random Forest etc).
